# EasyScreen
A simple to use screenshot program designed for all operating systems, but made because there's no good *simple* screenshot program for Linux.

Needs a lot of cleanup.

Press prntscr to open screenshot.
Currently only have a copy to clipboard function, soon to have save and upload to web.
